#This script contains a number of functions that will accomplish various data 
#handing or summary tasks.

#Function 1 - Country X and Y have different traditions for the delimiter in 
#their data files. Write a function that converts all files in a directory with 
#space- or tab-delimited data (.txt) into comma-separated value files.



#Function 2 - Write a function to compile data from all .csv files in a 
#directory into a single .csv file. The compiled data should have the original 
#twelve columns from daily data sheets, but also country and dayofYear columns. 
#The user should be able to choose whether they want to remove rows with NAâ€™s in
#any columns, include NAs in the compiled data but be warned of their presence, 
#or include NAs in the compiled data without a warning



#Function 3 - Write a function to summarize the compiled data set in terms of 
#number of screens run, percent of patients screened that were infected, male 
#vs. female patients, and the age distribution of patients.
